📚 BSc Thesis | Grocery Recommendation Systems Research

## Abstract

This research presents the development and implementation of a novel grocery recommendation system aimed at improving the grocery shopping experience while providing grocery enterprises with an opportunity to upscale their business strategies.

The study begins with an overview of the problem, the objectives, and the scope. It delves into consumer buying patterns, the types of grocery shopping, and explores advanced recommendation algorithms like NMF, SVD, and NCF.

The recommendation system is trained and tested on a diverse dataset, consisting of both real-world data and fictitious data, to comprehensively evaluate its performance and effectiveness. The system exhibits robust performance with real data and holds promise when dealing with larger datasets. Our investigation revealed that using implicit ratings, rather than explicit ratings, contributes to improved prediction accuracy.
